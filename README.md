# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
Utilizing the OpenWeather API and Google Maps API, this analysis project generates 2000 random (Lat,Long) combinations and cities derived from those coordinates. Data for each of these destination cities, including the coordination but also:
- maximum temperature
- percent humidity
- percent cloudiness
- wind speed
- weather description

Deliverables 2 & 3 were used to create a Vacation Search and Itinerary. 

## Vacation Search
Vacation Search utilizes user-input preference of maximum and minimum preferred temperatures, which is then utilized to form a search parameter for potential hotels and vacation cities that the user could consider for their trip. A pop-up marker map is then generated which offers a comprehensive look of all cities that meet the criteria, as well as the option to click and look at the description of each city destination.

## Vacation Itinerary
Vacation Itinerary simulates roundabout roadtrip planning and organizing from a home point city to three different destinations and back, to the total of a route that connects four different cities. Using directions API from Google, this deliverable shows the documented directions route between the cities and furthermore, shows different map markers between said cities.
